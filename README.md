# Taylor's Lookbook

A Posing guide look-book in a sinlge HTML file. Every "page" is just a section in the single file. The site works by the :target css selector turning display: on for the section you click to view. This little site is based on [cadars john-doe](https://github.com/cadars/john-doe) single file website. The webpage has no frameworks, database, or javascript necessary to run it. This look-book is meant to be a lite-site resource for posing and guiding for models and photographers in a photoshoot that can be accessed anywhere.

Happy picture taking.
